# Conduit Backend (Echo)

The backend of Conduit, a Medium-style blogging platform built on the RealWorld API contract: sign up and sign in, edit your profile, follow other authors, publish articles with tags, favorite them, read a personal feed and discuss in comments. It is a REST API built with Go, Echo v5 and PostgreSQL, organised as a modular monolith with Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture.

The browser client is the separate Conduit React frontend. The API follows `conduit-openapi/openapi.yml`, the same contract the frontend and the other Conduit backends are written against.

**Stack:** Go 1.27 · Echo v5 · PostgreSQL 18 · pgx · JWT (golang-jwt) · bcrypt · log/slog · go test · Docker · GitHub Actions

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.27+ and Docker.

```sh
cd conduit-docker
make docker/dev-up
cd ../conduit-backend
cp .env.example .env
make secret-key
make run
```

Paste the generated value into `AUTH_SECRET` in `.env`. The API runs at http://localhost:8080 and pgAdmin at http://localhost:8081 (login `admin@conduit.dev` / `admin`, server host `conduit-postgres`, user `dev_user`, password `dev_pass`). Migrations run automatically on startup. The `.env` file is loaded when present, and real environment variables always take precedence.

| Goal               | Command                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Run in development | `make run`                                 |
| Build binaries     | `make build` (writes to `bin/`)            |
| Apply migrations   | `make migrate`                             |
| Seed demo data     | `make seed`                                |
| Format code        | `make fmt`                                 |
| Run with Docker    | `make docker/up` (from `conduit-docker`)   |
| Seed in Docker     | `make docker/seed` (from `conduit-docker`) |
| Stop Docker        | `make docker/down` (from `conduit-docker`) |

`make docker/up` creates `conduit-docker/.env` with a random database password and `AUTH_SECRET` on the first run, then starts PostgreSQL and the API and waits until both are healthy. `PORT` overrides the host port in the Docker setup. The container always listens on port 8080. Demo logins after seeding: `johndoe123@mail.com` / `password123` and `jane@mail.com` / `securepassword456`. Seeding stops quietly when a demo user already exists, so running it twice never duplicates data, and it refuses to run when `APP_LEVEL` is `production` unless `SEED_ALLOW_PRODUCTION` is `true`.

## Features

- **Accounts**: sign up, sign in, read and update the current user (username, email, password, bio, image).
- **Profiles**: public profiles, follow and unfollow.
- **Articles**: create, read, update and delete, with tags, generated slugs, favorites, filtering by tag, author and favoriter, pagination and a feed of followed authors.
- **Comments**: list, add and delete comments on an article.
- **Tags**: the 20 most used tags.
- **Platform**: versioned SQL migrations embedded in the binaries, structured logging with daily rotated files, graceful shutdown on `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`, `GET /health` for health checks.

## Configuration

| Variable                | Default                 | Purpose                                                                                                  |

| `BCRYPT_ROUNDS`         | `10`                    | bcrypt cost factor                                                                                       |

Log files are written next to the console output as one JSON file per day, also rotated at 20 MB, compressed and kept for 14 days. The Docker image sets `LOG_TO_FILE=false`, so containers log to the console only.

Docker only, in `conduit-docker/.env`:

| Variable         | Default                 | Purpose                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`           | `8080`                  | Host port used by Docker               |
| `DB_NAME`        | `conduit`               | PostgreSQL database name               |
| `DB_USER`        | `conduit`               | PostgreSQL user                        |
| `DB_PASSWORD`    | required                | PostgreSQL password, generated by make |
| `AUTH_SECRET`    | required                | JWT secret, generated by make          |
| `AUTH_TOKEN_TTL` | `7d`                    | Lifetime of issued tokens              |
| `APP_LEVEL`      | `development`           | Environment level                      |
| `CLIENT_URL`     | `http://localhost:3000` | Allowed CORS origin                    |
| `LOG_LEVEL`      | `info`                  | Log level                              |

The frontend reaches the API through its own `/api` proxy (the Vite dev server or the nginx image), so no CORS setup is needed for the default stack. The backend still allows `CLIENT_URL` for direct cross-origin use.

### Modules

| Module     | Owns                                          | Uses from other modules                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `users`    | users, credentials, tokens, profiles, follows | none                                                   |
| `articles` | articles, tags, favorites                     | author profiles, followed ids (`users`)                |
| `comments` | comments                                      | author profiles (`users`), article lookup (`articles`) |

  application/             use cases and ports

  presentation/rest/       Echo handlers, middleware and routes

```

### Dependency rules

- Dependencies point inward: presentation and infrastructure depend on application, application depends on domain.
- Modules never import each other. What articles and comments need from users is the `AuthorDirectory` port declared in `shared/application`, which the users module implements. Comments need `ArticleCatalog`, which the articles module implements. The composition root in `bootstrap` wires them.
- Reactions travel through the in-process event bus. Deleting an article publishes `article.deleted`, and `comments` subscribes to remove the article's comments.
- Every I/O call takes a `context.Context`, so client disconnects and shutdown propagate to the database.
- Multi-row writes (an article with its tags) run in a transaction through `postgres.WithTransaction`.

### Request pipeline

1. CORS, then request logging.
2. `JSONBody` for everything under `/api/v1`: a non-JSON content type returns 415, a body above 256 KB returns 413, and a body that is not a JSON object or array returns 400.
3. Authentication per route: required, optional (public reads that personalise flags when a token is sent) or none.
4. The handler reads the envelope (`user`, `article` or `comment`) as raw fields, so an absent field, `null` and a value stay distinguishable.
5. Use cases check in a fixed order: authentication, existence, ownership, then validation.

## Database

Schema changes live in `internal/shared/infrastructure/postgres/migrations` as numbered `.sql` files and are embedded in the binaries. The migrator applies pending files in order, each inside a transaction, records them in `schema_migrations` and holds an advisory lock so concurrent starts do not race. It runs on every startup and through `make migrate`.

| Table          | Notes                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `users`        | `id` UUID, case-insensitive unique `email` and `username`, `password_hash`, nullable `bio` and `image` |
| `follows`      | `(follower_id, followed_id)` primary key, `CHECK` against following yourself                           |
| `articles`     | `id` UUID, `author_id`, unique `slug` (never `feed`), `seq` identity used as a stable tie breaker      |
| `article_tags` | `(article_id, position)` keeps tag order, unique `(article_id, tag)`, indexed on `tag`                 |
| `favorites`    | `(user_id, article_id)` primary key                                                                    |
| `comments`     | `id` bigint identity, `article_id`, `author_id`, `body` up to 1000 characters                          |

- Every foreign key uses `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so deleting an article removes its tags, favorites and comments.
- Article listings are ordered by `created_at` descending, then `seq` descending, so equal timestamps keep a stable order.
- Timestamps are `timestamptz` and returned as ISO 8601 UTC strings with milliseconds, for example `2026-12-08T10:00:00.000Z`.
- Popular tags are ordered by usage, then alphabetically with the `C` collation so the order does not depend on the server locale.

## API

All routes are under `/api/v1` and follow `conduit-openapi/openapi.yml`. Protected routes expect `Authorization: Token <jwt>`. Every error body has the shape `{ "errors": { "<field>": ["message"] } }`.

| Method | Path                           | Auth     | Purpose                                                   |

## Contract decisions

Where the contract leaves room, the API behaves as follows.

- **Check order** on protected routes: authentication, existence, ownership, then validation.
- **Authentication**: only the `Token` scheme is accepted. Optional-auth routes work anonymously without a header, but a header that is present must be valid. A valid token for a user that no longer exists is rejected.
- **Login** answers `401` identically for an unknown email and a wrong password, and spends comparable time in both cases.
- **Validation** trims text before measuring and counts Unicode characters. Passwords are not trimmed, need 8 to 72 characters and at most 72 bytes because bcrypt ignores the rest. All failing fields are reported together.
- **Registration conflicts** list every taken field (`email`, `username`), matched without regard to case. Emails are stored lowercase.
- **Missing envelope**: a body without the envelope key is treated as empty input, so it fails validation instead of crashing.
- **`PUT /user`** with no fields returns `422` with `user: can't be empty`. `PUT /articles/:slug` with no fields returns the article unchanged.
- **`bio` and `image`** are `null` when unset. Sending `null` or a blank string clears them, and `image` must be an `https` URL.
- **Slugs** come from the title (diacritics removed, lowercase, ASCII letters and digits separated by dashes). Collisions get `-2`, `-3` and so on, `feed` is reserved, and a changed title regenerates the slug, so the previous slug stops resolving.
- **Tags**: at most 10 per article after trimming and de-duplication, case sensitive, order kept. A blank tag is a validation error, and `null` or an empty list clears the tags.
- **Pagination**: `limit` defaults to 20 and is capped at 50, `offset` defaults to 0, and non-integers, `limit` below 1 or `offset` below 0 answer `422`. Unknown `author` or `favorited` usernames return an empty page.
- **Comment ids** that are not integers answer `422`, and ids too large to exist answer `404`.
- **Following yourself** answers `422`. Follow, unfollow, favorite and unfavorite are idempotent.

## Testing

| Suite       | Command                 | What it covers                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | `make test/unit`        | Domain rules, use cases with in-memory fakes, HTTP helpers, config, JWT and bcrypt, run with the race detector |
| Integration | `make test/integration` | Repositories, migrations and every HTTP route on a real PostgreSQL                                             |
| End to end  | `make test/e2e`         | Built binaries run as processes: startup, shutdown, seed and a user journey                                    |
| Coverage    | `make test/coverage`    | Unit and integration tests with coverage, writes `coverage.out`                                                |

Integration and e2e tests create a throwaway database per test through `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, which defaults to the development database from `make docker/dev-up`. The user needs the privilege to create databases. `make test/coverage` writes `coverage.out`. Other checks: `make fmt-check`, `make vet`, `make tidy-check`.

```sh
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres make test
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes to `main` and on pull requests, with three jobs in sequence:

1. **conduit code quality**: `make fmt-check`, `make vet` and `make tidy-check`.
2. **conduit code tests**: unit, integration and end-to-end suites against a PostgreSQL 18 service.
3. **conduit docker container**: builds the image, starts the Compose stack, then checks `/health`, registers a user, runs the seed and reads `/api/v1/articles`.

`.github/workflows/commitlint.yml` is a separate workflow that lints commit messages on pull requests, configured in `.commitlintrc.json`.

## Limits

- The API needs a running PostgreSQL.
- Profile images are URLs. The API does not store or serve uploads.
- Events are delivered in-process, so the app runs as a single instance.
- There is no account deletion or token revocation. Tokens simply expire after `AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`.
- Data from the former Taskly version is not migrated, since the domain is different. Start with an empty database.
